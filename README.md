**About**

This is a small social media web application built using Django. It allows users to create profiles, connect with friends, and share posts. 
The application is still under development, but it already has the following features:
User profiles: Users can create profiles that include their name, bio, and profile picture.
Friends: Users can send and receive friend requests. Once two users are friends, they can see each other's posts and send direct messages to each other.
Posts: Users can create posts that include text, images, and videos. Posts can be public or private.

**How to use the application**

To use the application, you will need to create an account. Once you have created an account, you can start creating posts, connecting with friends, and exploring the application.
To create a post, simply click on the "Create Post" button and enter your text, images, and/or videos. You can also choose to make your post public or private.
To connect with friends, click on the "Friends" tab and then click on the "Add Friend" button next to the friend you want to add. Once you have sent a friend request,
the other user will need to accept it before you can become friends.
To explore the application, you can browse the public posts feed or search for specific users or posts.

**Future plans**

The following features are planned for future releases of the application:
Direct messaging: Users will be able to send direct messages to each other.
Groups: Users will be able to create and join groups. Groups will allow users to share posts and chat with other members of the group.
Notifications: Users will be notified when they receive a new friend request, message, or like/comment on their post.

**Why Django?**

Django is a popular Python web framework that is known for its speed, security, and scalability. It is also very easy to learn and use. 
These are all important factors for a social media web application, which is why Django was chosen for this project.
